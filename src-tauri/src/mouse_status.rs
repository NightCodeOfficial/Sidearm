//! capture helper gone for good, side buttons that cannot be read, a mouse the
//! guard cannot reach, an offline profile that was not stored, a signal switch.

//! States (`set_state`) hold until cleared and show in the Mouse tab; notices
//! (`notice`) are shown once as a toast. Both are emitted as
//! [`EVENT_MOUSE_STATUS`] and kept here for a window that opens later
//! (`snapshot`) — a notice raised at startup must not be lost before the UI
